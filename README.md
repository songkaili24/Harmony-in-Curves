# Artwork Overview
The underlying mathematical structure of these artworks is defined by a parametric equation:

x(t) = A * sin(a * t) + B * sin(b * t)
y(t) = C * cos(c * t) + D * cos(d * t)

Here, t is the parameter that varies over time, and A, B, C, D, a, b, c, and d are constants influencing the shape and appearance of the curves. Feel free to explore how changing these constants affects the visual outcome of the curves.

# Viewing and Verification
To explore and verify the mathematical foundation of these artworks:

Utilize graphing tools like Desmos, Wolfram Alpha, or Python with Matplotlib to input the parametric equation and constants.

Observe how the changing values of t influence the curves.

Compare the visual output with the mathematical equation provided in this README.

Experiment with altering constants to see their impact on the shape and pattern.

# Components:

Understand the role of each term in the equationã€‚
A * sin(a * t) and B * sin(b * t) contribute to the horizontal component.
C * cos(c * t) and D * cos(d * t) affect the vertical component.

# Experimentation:

Experiment with different sets of constants to observe how subtle changes lead to diverse visual outcomes.

# Artistic Intuition:

Recognize that artistic intuition may influence color choices, line thickness, or additional artistic elements.

# A note from the creator

This collection seeks to bridge the gap between mathematics and art, inviting viewers to appreciate the aesthetic beauty derived from underlying mathematical principles.
